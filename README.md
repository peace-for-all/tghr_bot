# tghr_bot
Bot for communication with HRs (answer the FAQ)

Because HRs always ask the same questions:
- experience? 
- are you looking for a job now?
- education?
- years in profession?
- cv please?

This _has_ to be automated. :-)

## Features
- Works on Telegram (t.me/tghr_bot)
- Sends my cv or answers basic questions about my job seeking status

## Setup instructions

(if you need them, please, ask me directly @peace-for-all)

## Roadmap

I'm going to make it _multiplayer_. :) 
So that you can
- upload your resume
- it parses and
- answers questions about you.

I haven't started this part of work yet, bcs busy with more interesting projects. But, if you could need this, please ask me or send a pull request.
